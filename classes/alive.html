            <dt>Review</dt>
            <dd>
              Last week, we talked &mdash; well, I talked, anyway &mdash; about
              the web browser's job. I tried to help everybody understand that
              the browser was designed to show content based on old ideas taken
              from the world of book, magazine, and newspaper printing.
              The main concepts were the two basic ways the browser approaches
              the problem of showing your information on the screen:
              <span class='terminology'>block content</span> and
              <span class='terminology'>inline content</span>.
              <p>
              I went over some miscellaneous new (to us) tags.
              There were the block tags
              <span class='code'>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</span>, and
              <span class='code'>div</span>, and the inline tags
              <span class='code'>i, b</span>, and
              <span class='code'>span</span>.
              The <span class='code'>div</span> and <span class='code'>span</span>
              tags are interesting because they just mean
              "this is a block" or "this is just a grouping of inline content".
              <p>
              Finally, we talked about a way to make a tag have a special
              "personality" by assigning a value to an
              <span class='terminology'>attribute</span>
              of a tag, specifically the <span class='code'>class</span>
              attribute.
            </dd>

            <dt>First, More Tags</dt>
            <dd>
              We'll get to the JavaScript stuff in a second, but first I'll
              introduce a couple more tags just for fun.
              The first is an inline tag called <span class='code'>img</span>, which
              lets you put pictures on a web page.
              The <span class='code'>img</span> tag is interesting because
              it's the first tag we've seen that requires an attribute
              in order for it to make sense.
              <p>
              Browsers allow images to be part of web pages, but you don't
              just put the image in the middle of your HTML program directly.
              Images in computers are stored as complicated jumbles of
              numbers &mdash; lots of numbers. A single image, especially
              a photograph, is probably much, much larger (in terms of how
              much room it takes up inside your computer) than any HTML or
              CSS program you'll ever write. Thus, it would be really ugly
              to directly include a gigantic pile of numbers right in the
              middle of your nice neat HTML.
              <p>
              So, instead of putting the raw image directly in the middle
              of your HTML, you tell the browser where to get your image.
              In other words, your HTML program will include an
              <span class='code'>img</span>
              tag that tells the browser the name of your image.
              When the browser sees the tag, it looks for an
              attribute called
              <span class='code'>src</span>
              to find out the "name" of your image.
              An image tag, therefore, might look like this:
              <code>
                &lt;img src='cute_kitten.jpg'&gt;
              </code>
              Now, there's another funny thing about the
              <span class='code'>img</span>
              tag.  Unlike the other tags we've seen, the
              <span class='code'>img</span>
              tag cannot have any content. In effect, the image
              itself is the content, so it just doesn't make
              sense to put anything "inside" it.
              Therefore, you'll never see
              <code>
                &lt;/img&gt;
              </code>
              (or, if you do, it's just a mistake, and the browser will
              ignore it anyway).
            </dd>

            <dt>What's In A Name?</dt>
            <dd>
              These "names" I mentioned when talking about images: what are they?
              Well, a name of something on the web is called a
              <span class='terminology'>URL</span>.
              You're probably familiar with the idea; here are some URLs:
              <pre style='padding-left: 4em'>
                http://www.amazon.com
                http://google.com
                http://twitter.com/FridayCoopWeb
              </pre>
              There are all sort of weird rules about the different parts
              of a URL, but that's all pretty boring and not very interesting
              for us at the moment.  For us, jsfiddle takes care of most of
              it for us. However, for images, we will in fact need to have
              an image somewhere that's actually got an Internet name &mdash;
              a URL.
              <p>
              This problem we face is also a problem that real-life web
              developers face all the time.
              If I want to use our friend jsfiddle to try out an experiment,
              and I need an image, I do what lots of web developers do: I
              use a "placeholder" site.
              A placeholder site is a website, usually completely free for
              everybody to use, that lets you create an Internet name (URL)
              and it will send an image back to your browser.
              There are several placeholder sites, but really the only
              ones that you need to know are:
              <pre style='padding-left: 4em'>
                http://placekitten.com
                http://placedog.com
              </pre>
              To make up a URL for an image, you just pick an image size
              in pixels (remember: "pixel" basically means "dot on your
              screen").  Here's a 200x200 image from placekitten.com:
              <div><img src='http://placekitten.com/200/200'></div>
              <p>
              The URL for that kitten is "http://placekitten.com/200/200".
              The first number determines the width, and the second number
              determines the height.  You can pick just about any size you
              want, and there are lots of different kittens.
            </dd>

            <dt>I Love Buttons</dt>
            <dd>
              You've probably seen many, many buttons on web pages you've
              used. There are buttons all over jsfiddle for example.
              You can make a button in HTML with an inline tag called <span class='code'>button</span>.
              A button, unlike an image, does have content.
              In the simple case, the content of a button is a short
              phrase that will show up on the button:
              <code>
                &lt;button&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;
              </code>
              A button can contain almost any inline content (but not another button!),
              including an image.
              So you could make a dog button like this:
              <code>
                &lt;button&gt;
                  &lt;img src="http://placedog.com/100/60"&gt;
                &lt;/button&gt;
              </code>
            </dd>

            <dt>Tags, Elements, and Identity</dt>
            <dd>
              We're familiar with the word "tag".
              There's another word that I'll use and that you'll see
              in books or blog posts about web programming, and that's
              "element".
              The difference in meaning is pretty subtle.
              A tag is a tag, but when you put a tag into an
              HTML program it becomes an element of that web page.
              In other words, when you talk about the different bits
              and pieces of a web page, you talk about the elements
              on the page.  Each element is a tag, but we think
              of it in a slightly different way based on how it
              works in a particular page. It's kind of like the
              difference between an actor's name and the name
              of a character in a play or movie.
              <p>
              By the way that reminds me: there's another placeholder
              site called "placesheen.com":
              <div><img src='http://placesheen.com/200/200'></div>
              <p>
              Sometimes it's important to give a particular element
              on a page a completely unique name. To do that, you
              can add an <span class='code'>id</span>
              attribute to an element. Here's a button with a unique
              name:
              <code>
                &lt;button id="launch"&gt;Launch The Rocket&lt;/button&gt;
              </code>
              In case you want to write a CSS rule for that one particular
              button, you'd do it like this:
              <code>
                #launch { color: red; }
              </code>
              You don't even have to tell CSS that the rule is for
              <span class='code'>button</span>
              tags, because that unique name ("launch") has
              to be really and truly unique &mdash; no other element
              on the page can be called "launch".
              In the CSS selector, all you need is the symbol "#" (called
              a "pound sign", or "sharp" by some people) and then the
              unique name that you put for the
              <span class='code'>id</span>
              attribute.  (No space in between them!!)
            </dd>

            <dt>Finally JavaScript</dt>
            <dd>
              JavaScript is by far the most powerful of the three web
              programming languages we're studying.
              What does "powerful" mean?
              Well, for us it means that there's much, much more you
              can do to control what a browser does with JavaScript
              than with the other languages.
              HTML and CSS are both mostly "static", which means that
              they say what them want the browser to do, and the browser
              does it, and that's pretty much that.
              They're kind-of like the instructions that come with a
              Lego kit.  You build the kit, and then you stare at it or
              play with it or whatever, and the instructions don't matter
              anymore.
              <p>
              JavaScript, however, lets you "motorize" your web pages.
              It lets you make your page respond to things that a person
              looking at the page do, like move the mouse, click on 
              buttons, type on the keyboard, or scroll the page up and
              down.
              Your JavaScript code can change the page in all sorts of
              ways by adding or even removing elements.
              JavaScript also lets you change details of tags, especially
              the value of element attributes.
              <p>
              JavaScript is a really neat language, so we're going to
              start off slowly.
              We're also going to be using a very powerful "add on"
              tool for JavaScript called "jQuery".
              This tool (or "library", as programmers call such things)
              was written by a lovely young man named John Resig.
              The point of jQuery is to make it much easier for your
              JavaScript programs to control your web pages. It's
              very popular among real web developers, and many, many
              real websites use it.
            </dd>

            <dt>First Simple Step: Button Clicks</dt>
            <dd>
              Let's get started by jumping right in and looking at
              something we can do with buttons.
              When you do something on a web page like clicking on
              a button, the browser considers that to be a special
              moment called an <span class='terminology'>event</span>.
              The word "event" is always used, even if the thing that
              you did with the page doesn't seem very special.
              Even just moving your mouse without clicking is
              considered an "event" by the browser.
              Usually, the browser associates a particular element
              on a web page as being the "target" of an event.
              That relationship is generally pretty clear &mdash; when
              you click on a button, for example, there's a "click"
              event, and the "target" is the button element itself.
              <p>
              The primary way that your JavaScript code will "motorize"
              your web pages is by telling the browser what to do
              when certain events happen.
              From JavaScript, with jQuery, that's very easy to do,
              especially now that we're CSS experts!
              <p>
              The jQuery library lets you identify web page elements
              with the very same "selector" things that you know from
              CSS. What we're going to look at is a simple page with
              a button and some words.
              Our example will use the button make the words change
              color. Here's the HTML:
              <code>
                &lt;button id='clicker'&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;div id='words'&gt;
                  I wonder if I'll actually see Justin Bieber today?
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              <p>
              We'll also need a little bit of CSS:
              <code>
                #words.clicked { color: red; }
              </code>
              Remember that "." from last time?  That's what you put
              in a CSS selector to tell it that you're interested
              in elements with a particular class.  In this case,
              it means, "this rule is for the element whose unique
              name is 'words', but only if it has the class
              'clicked'."  But wait &mdash; in that HTML I just showed
              you, there was no "clicked" class.  That's right! We're
              going to use JavaScript to do that!
              <p>
              What we'll do is tell the web browser that when I click on
              the button named "clicker", it should add that "clicked"
              class to the element named "words". That's going to look
              like this:
              <code>
                $('#clicker').click(function() {
                
                  $('#words').addClass('clicked');

                });
              </code>
              That's JavaScript, though because we're using jQuery it's
              got a particular look to it. (It's like how people from
              England and people from Texas may speak English, but it
              sounds different.)
              JavaScript is really quite a bit different than CSS and
              HTML.
              We can say that an HTML program is a bunch of tags, and
              that CSS is a list of rules.
              With JavaScript, we talk about things called
              <span class='terminology'>statements</span>.
              A statement in JavaScript can take many different forms.
              In that example above, there are two statements, one
              inside another.
              <p>
              In a way similar to how an HTML tag can "contain" another
              tag, a JavaScript statement can contain other statements.
              There are different ways that may happen, and different
              things that the relationship between the statments can
              mean.`
              Here are the key things to notice:
              <ul>
                <li>The dollar sign is "the mark of jQuery".  It's like a web page Swiss Army knife and we'll use it for all sorts of things.
                <li>Note that after each of the dollar signs in this example, there's
                a quoted CSS selector string.  Recognize them?  That's how we'll tie together
                our JavaScript code with our HTML code.
                <li>See the word "click", right after the dot? That is the jQuery way 
                to tell the browser that we want it to do something when there's
                a mouse click event.  In particular, a mouse click event on the
                element selected with that selector.
                <li>The word "function" is super magic and we'll talk about it a lot.
                For now, think of it as "hocus pocus" or something.
                <li>Notice that JavaScript uses curly braces too, and in a similar
                way to CSS.  In this case, we'll say that those curly braces mark
                the start and the end of the function <span class='terminology'>body</span>.
                (Yes, the word "body" means something in HTML too. It's so confusing.)
                <li>Inside the function body, there's another jQuery statement with
                a selector that refers to our block of words.
                <li>Finally, it's safe for you to guess what "addClass" means.
              </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>Trying It Out</dt>

              It's no fun to just look at boring code.
              I've already typed in the HTML and the CSS, and you can go find the jsfiddle here:
              <pre style='padding-left: 4em;'>
                <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/Pointy/7afxS/' target='_blank'>http://jsfiddle.net/Pointy/7afxS/ </a>
              </pre>
              Click on that, and you should see a new window (or a new browser tab)
              with the pre-typed jsfiddle.
              If you then type that JavaScript into the JavaScript box and hit the "Run" button,
              well, nothing will happen right away.
              However, if you click that button, something should happen - can you guess what?
              <p>
              There's another jQuery function similar to "addClass", called "removeClass".
              Can you think of what you might have to do in order to have two buttons
              on the page instead of one, so that you could have a button to turn the words
              red and another button to make them not be red?
              <p>
              What if you wanted another button to make the words blue instead of red? How could you do that?
              How would you do it to have the choice of red or blue?
              <p>
              Our CSS rule is just an ordinary rule here &mdash; CSS doesn't even know that
              the JavaScript is there!  It's just a rule, so it can contain any other
              properties we've played with:
              <ul>
                <li>background-color
                <li>font-size
                <li>border-width
              </ul>
              You can find out about lots and lots of CSS properties from sites like the
              <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS_Reference'>Mozilla Documentation Network</a>
              but be warned that CSS properties can be kind-of weird. Some of them don't even
              work; it's a strange situation.
