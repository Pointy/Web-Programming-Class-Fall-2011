            <dd>
              This week we'll expand our JavaScript skills with some
              really cool capabilities that jQuery provides for us.
              First, recall that last week I went on and on about
              boxes again, and we learned about box borders, padding,
              and margin. We played with curved corners on boxes,
              and we used some JavaScript to add and remove classes
              from elements in response to mouse movements.
            </dd>

            <dt>Quick Note</dt>
            <dd>
              Something that I didn't manage to point out very clearly
              last week is a really powerful aspect of using jQuery
              the way we're using it.  Recall that I wrote some
              JavaScript code that started with:

              <code>
                $("div.tricky").mouseenter(function() {
                  // ... stuff ... this is called a
                  // "comment" by the way
                });
              </code>

              It's important to note that by using that CSS-style selector
              ("div.tricky") we told the browser, "Find all of the div
              elements that have class 'tricky' and do this thing."  (And
              "this thing" was to set up an event handler for the "mouseenter"
              event.)
              That's a great feature and we're going to explore it some
              more this week.
            </dd>

            <dt>What Can JavaScript Do?</dt>
            <dd>
              We've seen already that we can write JavaScript code that
              tells the browser to make changes to parts of our HTML code
              (which we usually refer to as "the document").
              We'll eventually see that JavaScript (with help from jQuery)
              we can do almost anything we want: change elements, add new elements,
              and remove elements.
              <p>
              For now, however, we're going to concentrate on the more
              general case of what we've already done.  Recall that in
              our projects so far we've affected elements by changing the
              "class" attribute:
              <code>
                $(this).addClass("something");
              </code>
              (Remember "this" from last time?  In an event handler, that
              always is a shortcut for the element where the event happened.)
              <p>
              What we've done with JavaScript code like that is alter
              the value of "class" attributes on our elements. In other
              words, what happens when we do that is that our element
              that started off like this:
              <code>
                &lt;div class="tricky"&gt;
                  Please buy this kitten ...
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              is effectively changed so that it looks like this:
              <code>
                &lt;div class="tricky something"&gt;
                  Please buy this kitten ...
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              Now, it's not really changed in any sort of permanent way.
              Instead, what's changing is the web browser's internal
              "map" of the whole document, which is something that people
              call "the DOM" (Document Object Model).  We don't have to
              worry too much about the specific details of how the DOM
              looks or works because, mostly, jQuery will make that pretty
              easy for us. (It's worth learning someday though, if you're
              really interested in how stuff works.)
              <p>
              Thus, what we've been doing is using a jQuery feature to
              make changes to the "class" attribute value on selected
              elements in our document.
            </dd>

            <dt>Doing It In Style</dt>
            <dd>
              So far we've used the "class" attribute as a way to tie
              together our HTML code and our CSS code (and, for that 
              matter, our JavaScript code too!).  That's a very
              important, I'd say even fundamental, way of doing things
              in web software.
              <p>
              If you think for a second about what it might be like to
              have to manage a really big web site, with lots and lots
              of HTML pages and lots of corresponding CSS, you might
              start to wonder how anybody keeps track of it all.
              Well that's a great thing to wonder about because it turns
              out to be a really hard part of working with web software
              (and any kind of software, really).  One aspect of this
              in web software is that the use of those class names
              to control appearance can get kind-of messy once we've
              got a huge amount of HTML to worry about.  At some
              point the number of separate little rules like this:
              <code>
                div.tricky { background-color: orange; }
              </code>
              starts to get big.  It's a great mechanism for setting up
              the more "standard" or often-repeated parts of the web
              site (say, the titles on every page, the way paragraphs
              should look in ordinary text, borders around certain kinds
              of content, and so on).  However it's very common for there
              to be special little details that only happen in one or
              two places throughout all the HTML.
              <p>
              For this reason, web software developers have a choice
              for where to keep the bits and pieces of CSS properties.
              The way we've been doing it involves CSS separated out
              into a sort-of world of its own.  The other choice is
              to use another HTML attribute: <span class='code'>style</span>.
              The style attribute can be used with any HTML tag.
              The value of the style attribute should look like the
              body (the part between "{" and "}") of a CSS rule:
              <code>
                &lt;div class='tricky' style='width: 200px; border-color: green'&gt;
                  Please buy this kitten ...
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              You can think of the style attribute as a way to create
              a CSS rule that applies uniquely to that particular element
              and no others. In the strange and wonderful way that CSS
              rules are applied to elements, this special unique rule
              taken from the style attribute is considered the most
              important.  Setting a property in the style attribute 
              will override any other setting that might come from 
              an ordinary CSS rule like the ones we've been using so far.
            </dd>

            <dt>JavaScript, jQuery, and Style</dt>
            <dd>
              Well as you might have guessed, JavaScript and jQuery make
              it easy for us to fool around with the value of style
              attributes on our HTML elements, just like we can fool
              around with the value of class attributes.
              When using jQuery, the simplest and easiest way to 
              do this is with a jQuery function called "css":
              <code>
                $('div.tricky').mouseenter(function() {
                  $(this).css({
                    "background-color": "red",
                    "border-width": "5px"
                  });
                });
              </code>
              Note that our CSS code in the middle of that JavaScript
              code doesn't look exactly like "real" CSS.  That's because
              it isn't real CSS &mdash; it's JavaScript. It looks
              almost the same, but because there simply is no way to
              get the web browser to understand that we want a blob of
              CSS in the middle of a bigger blob of JavaScript, we
              have to make do.  Thus, the differences are as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>The CSS property names and values have to be quoted.
                <li>Instead of semi-colons (";"), the property/value settings
                are separated by commas (","), but there's no comma after
                the last one.
              </ul>
              It's sort-of regrettable, but honestly you get used to
              it pretty quickly.
            </dd>

            <dt>A Family of Handy Attributes</dt>
            <dd>
              Finally I want to mention a "family" of attributes
              that are especially useful from JavaScript.
              I use the word "family" because it's not just one
              particular attribute, but an essentially infinite
              set of attributes that all kind-of look the same.
              These attributes are called "data" attributes,
              and they look like this:
              <code>
                &lt;div data-favorite-color="red"&gt;
                  Please buy this kitten ...
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              Now if all you've got is HTML and CSS, then those
              attributes really won't do you any good at all.
              But when you throw JavaScript into the mix, then
              they provide a way of communicating any sort if
              information you want between HTML and JavaScript.
              It's like being able to make up your very own
              custom attributes.  They mean nothing at all
              to the browser except by way of whatever your 
              JavaScript code says they should mean.
            </dd>

            <dt>Things To Do</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/Pointy/b8FPh/3/'>Here is this week's jsfiddle.</a>
              This is just a variation on what we did last time, with
              a few more CSS goodies thrown in.  What we're going
              to do is modify our "mouseenter" and "mouseleave"
              event handlers in two ways:
              <ol>
                <li>Instead of adding/removing class names, we're going
                to change the appearance by directly updating the style
                attribute of elements the mouse moves over.
                <li>We're going to use a data attribute to let each
                of the HTML elements involved tell us the color to make
                the border.
              </ol>
              To do that, we'll use this JavaScript code:
              <code>
                $('div.tricky').mouseenter(function() {
                  var newBorderColor;

                  newBorderColor = $(this).data('favorite-color') || 'black';
                  
                  $(this).css({
                    'margin': '10px',
                    'padding': '5px',
                    'border-width': 11px,
                    'border-color': newBorderColor
                  });
                });
                $('div.tricky').mouseleave(function() {
                  $(this).css({
                    'margin': '', 'padding': '', 'border-width': '', 'border-color': ''
                  });
                });
              </code>
              There are some important new things in that code:
              <ul>
                <li>Note the use of this ".css()" thing to update
                the style on the affected element (this)
                <li>The first line of the "mouseenter" event handler
                is new: that's called a <span class='terminology'>variable declaration</span>.
                We'll talk more about those, but suffice to say that
                we're telling JavaScript that we want to use that
                name ("newBorderColor") to mean something in our 
                code.
                <li>The next thing we see looks like a little bit
                of algebra, sort-of.  That "=" sign does not, however,
                mean that we're telling JavaScript that those two things
                are "equal".  Instead, we're telling it that we want it
                to make them equal by having that name "newBorderColor"
                be whatever that stuff on the other side of "=" is.
                <li>Now, that stuff on the right side of the "=" is
                how we get at our "data-favorite-color" attribute.
                We start with "$(this)" again, and use the jQuery
                "data()" function (thankfully the jQuery people are
                pretty good about making up function names).  Note 
                that we don't have to prefix our name with "data-".
                The very last part, starting with "||", means that
                if there's no such data attribute on the element to
                just use "black" as the color name.
              </ul>
              What other sorts of things can you think of that "data-" attributes
              might be good for?
              <p>
              Did you notice that our boxes are sitting next to each other?
              Can you figure out from the CSS how I did that?
              <p>
              Here's a deep philosophical question: how does one know when
              to use "addClass" and "removeClass" to change appearance versus
              using our new friend the "css" function?
