              My name is Mike McNally.  Patrick McNally, Christopher McNally, and Allison McNally are my kids.
              I do web programming for a small company in Austin.
              <p>
              What are your names?

            <dt>Course Goals</dt>
            <dd>
              We're going to learn a little bit about web programming.  How much?  We'll find out!
              <p>
              Most classes will involve me going "blah blah blah" for a little while, to introduce
              new things about web programming.  The rest of the classes will be you working away
              creating web pages.  This first day, I need to "blah blah" for a little longer
              because there are many words and ideas we have to learn to get started.
              <p>
              We may or may not have enough laptops for everybody to use, but we will certainly
              have enough for two-person teams. Programmers call that "Pair Programming" and
              quite a few programmers actually work that way!
            </dd>

            <dt>What is "Programming"?</dt>
            <dd>
              Programming just means "telling a computer what to do."  It takes many, many forms.
              So, as a noun, a "program" is a blob of stuff that tells a computer what to do.
              Except it's not really <i>stuff</i>; it's more like an idea that you've written down somehow.
              <p>
              Most of the time, it's a little more accurate to say that programming means, "telling
              a computer program what to do."  Computers operate with layers and layers of programs,
              all working together. Sometimes, not working together.
              <p>
              When you write a short story, you create <b>literature</b>.  When you write a computer
              program, you create <b>software.</b>
            </dd>

            <dt>Web Programming</dt>
            <dd>
              The <b>web</b> is a system that lets people with computers look at information
              stored on other computers.  It is built on another system, the <b>Internet</b>,
              which is a more general system for inter-computer communication.
              <p>
              People, companies, and other organizations have information of all sorts, and they
              want to share it.  When information is made available via the web, it forms a
              <b>web site</b>.  It's not necessarily a real "site" on Earth somewhere. A
              web site may be just one little computer, or it may be made up of
              lots and lots of computers spread out all over the place.
              <p>
              A single part of a web site is called a <b>web page</b>.  Web programming is
              all about making web pages.  Sound simple?  Well, it is, but the things you
              can do inside one little web page are amazing!
              <p>
              An important part of the web as a system is a computer program called a
              <b>web browser</b>.  A web browser is a program that runs on your own
              computer; it is not a web site.  "Internet Explorer", "Firefox", "Chrome",
              and "Safari" are all names of popular web browsers. The number one job of
              a web browser is to show web pages.
              <p>
              Phew! That was a lot of stuff.  But now we can see that "web programming"
              means, "telling a web browser what to do."
            </dd>

            <dt>Languages and Computers</dt>
            <dd>
              To tell a computer or a web browser what to do, we use specialized
              <b>languages</b>.  Computer languages are not like English or Spanish;
              they're much simpler than people languages. There are lots and lots
              of different ones, for many purposes.
              <p>
              Computer languages are made up by people, not computers.
              <p>
              For web programming, we will learn about three important languages: <b>HTML</b>,
              <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>.  There are others, but those are the three
              that are specifically about web pages.  You can think of a web page as being
              a cooperative effort between several separate programs written in one or more
              of those languages.  There's almost always HTML involved, and usually CSS and
              JavaScript too.
            </dd>

            <dt>HTML + CSS + JavaScript</dt>
            <dd>
              The three languages we'll talk about are responsible for three different
              aspects of a web page:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  HTML provides the <b>content</b> of a page; the information itself
                  that you want to share. In addition to words and pictures, HTML
                  tells the browser how the information should be interpreted.
                  An example is the difference between the title of a story and
                  the story itself, or how the story is broken up into paragraphs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  CSS tells the browser about the <b>appearance</b> of the
                  content.  The appearance includes the size and shape of letters
                  to be used for text, the colors to use, and where on the screen
                  different parts of the content should go.
                </li>
                <li>
                  JavaScript tells the browser about <b>behaviors</b>.  This is
                  the most complicated part, because it's all about how the page
                  should <b>interact</b> with you while you look at it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              These languages are all very different from each other, but there
              are many interesting ways that connections are made between
              programs based on the nature of the actual content.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <dt>HTML</dt>
          <dd>
            An HTML program is built up (mostly) of things called <b>tags</b>.
            Tags are the way that HTML tells the browser about the differences
            between the parts of the information that a page should show you
            when you look at it.
            <p>
            There is a specific set of tags available to describe information.
            We'll learn a lot of them as we go through the class.
          </dd>

          <dt>CSS</dt>
          <dd>
            A CSS program is built up of things called <b>rules</b>.  A
            single rule tells the browser how certain parts of the information
            should look. CSS programs do this by referring to the names of
            tags (and other things about tags), and then providing
            guidance for appearance details like color and size.
