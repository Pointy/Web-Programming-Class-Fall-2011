            <dd>
              The <b>web</b> is a vast system built on the <b>internet</b>.
              It was designed for scientists and researchers to share information,
              and today it's used by zillions of people for all sorts of purposes.
              <p>
              Information on the web is made available by organizing it into
              <b>web sites</b>. A web site is made up of basic pieces called
              <b>web pages</b>.
              <p>
              One of the most important parts of the web is a computer program
              called a <b>browser</b>.  Your browser understands 3 important
              programming languages that allow you to tell it what to do:
              <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>.
              <p>
              HTML describes the <b>content</b> of a web page.
              CSS tells the browser about the <b>appearance</b> of the content.
              JavaScript tells the browser how the page should <b>behave</b>.
            </dd>

            <dt>The Problem</dt>
            <dd>
              The basic job of your browser is to show you web pages.
              More precisely, HTML and CSS (and, to a lesser extent, JavaScript)
              were designed to allow web pages to be described, and your
              browser's job is to understand what the HTML and CSS you feed it
              means, and then carry out those instructions so that you see
              the page properly.
              <p>
              Back a long long time ago, when printing on paper was first
              invented, people used little blocks &mdash; almost like alphabet
              blocks &mdash; with letters and symbols. To print a story or
              a book, lots and lots of those blocks would be put together
              to make all the words of the book.  A frame would hold those
              letters in place, and then they could print pages.
              <p> 
              Eventually, big giant machines were developed to make printing
              faster. Controlling those machines required a lot of special
              skills.  When people made newspapers or things like that, usually
              there would be people who wrote stories, people who decided where
              the stories would go in the newspaper (and other things like
              headlines and drawings), and still other people who would actually
              tell the printing machinery what to do.
              <p>
              The people who wrote stories and decided how the newspaper should
              look developed a system, called <b>markup</b>, that would tell the
              printing expert what they wanted to be done.
              The person controlling the printing machinery didn't really care
              what the newspaper <i>said</i>.  They just had to worry about
              carrying out the instructions specified by the markup.
            </dd>

            <dt>HTML Is Markup</dt>
            <dd>
              When the researcher who designed HTML originally thought about the
              problem, therefore, there was already a long history of markup.
              In fact, there were lots of markup systems already designed for
              computers. One of those, called <b>SGML</b>, was popular in the 
              1980's.
              <p>
              Starting from SGML, then, Mr. Berners-Lee created a much-simplified
              variation, and that was the beginning of HTML.
            </dd>

            <dt>How Are Antique Printers Like HTML?</dt>
            <dd>
              Think back to those "frames" of alphabet blocks we talked about.
              Think about what newspapers look like.
              If you squint your eyes and just think about the shapes on a
              page of newsprint, you see boxes of information going down the
              page, one on top of the other. Inside the boxes, letters, spaces,
              and punctuation just sort of "flow", line by line through the
              boxes.
              <p>
              (We'll talk about the columns that go <i>across</i> the page.
              For now, we'll concentrate on boxes piled one on top of the
              other, going <i>down</i> the page.)
              <p>
              Almost all computer-oriented markup systems are based on that
              simple idea: boxes of flowing text, piled on top of each other.
              HTML is like that.  The basic thing you do in your HTML programs
              is organize your content, like text for stories or poems and illustrations
              and pictures, into boxes.
            </dd>

            <dt>Wait I Thought This Was About CSS</dt>
            <dd>
              It is about CSS.  The job of HTML is to organize your content
              into boxes. CSS says what the boxes (and the content inside the boxes)
              should look like.
              The two work together to determine how a web page looks.
              <p>
              However, HTML is "older" than CSS.
              That means that when HTML first existed, there was no such
              thing as CSS.
              HTML allows you to put your content into boxes such that
              a browser can know how to show it even without CSS.
              The way that works is based on a family of <b>tags</b>
              (remember tags from last week?) that make different
              kinds of boxes.
            </dd>

            <dt>Paragraphs</dt>
            <dd>
              Last week we looked at a particular kind of box,
              the <b>paragraph</b> box.
              Paragraphs are a pretty basic kind of box.
              Recall that to make a paragraph, we use some 
              HTML that looks like this:
              <code>
                &lt;p&gt;
                  This is a lovely paragraph.
                  I think it may be my favorite paragraph ever.
                &lt;/p&gt;
              </code>
              There are other kinds of boxes too.
              For example, there's a family of "header" tags,
              "h1" through "h6", that can be used to 
              identify chapter and section titles:
              <code>
                &lt;h1&gt;My Summer Vacation&lt;/h1&gt;
              </code>
              The browser knows that second-level headings should
              be a little smaller than chapter titles, etc.
              <p>
              There's another kind of box that's a sort-of
              "generic" box.
              The "div" tag makes a box, but it's a box without
              any pre-arranged meaning. In other words, the 
              browser knows it's a box, so it knows it stacks
              on top of other boxes, but it doesn't associate
              it with any particular kind of information.
              <p>
              (Can you guess how it will be possible to control what
              content in a "div" tag looks like?)
            </dd>

            <dt>Box Me In</dt>
            <dd>
              Inside boxes, we find <b>inline</b> content.
              The simplest inline content is just blah blah
              blah text:
              <code>
                &lt;p&gt;
                  This summer was fun. I went to a beach. My
                  little brother got sunburned and a fish bit
                  him but so what. I had lots of cotton candy.
                &lt;/p&gt;
              </code>
              The browser knows that simple text should just be strung along,
              letter by letter. It also knows to break at the edge of the page
              and start over on the next line.
              <p>
              There are some tags that don't make boxes. Instead, they tell
              the browser that a stretch of inline content has some overall
              relationship. One example is the title of a movie, which is
              traditionally shown as <i>italic text</i>:
              <code>
                &lt;p&gt;
                  Yesterday my sister went to see
                  &lt;i&gt;Forever Bieber&lt;/i&gt; and ever
                  since she's been hyperventilating
                  with excitement.
                &lt;/p&gt;
              </code>
              The "i" tag tells the browser to use italic letters. (Wait a 
              minute &mdash; I thought it was CSS's job to control appearance!)
              <p>
              Just like with blocks, there's a "generic" inline content tag
              that lets content be grouped without any particular reason. It's
              called "span".  (How much do you think you could accomplish with
              just "div" and "span" in an HTML page?)
            </dd>

            <dt>Every Tag Is Special</dt>
            <dd>
              Well, not really. So far all we've seen in CSS is that we can
              make all paragraphs turn purple, and stuff like that. I don't know
              about you, but sometimes I like certain paragraphs to be different.
              <p>
              HTML and CSS, thankfully, give us lots of neat-o ways to make our
              plain anonymous tags more "special".  The first way we'll talk about
              is the idea of categorizing or "classifying" our tags.  In HTML,
              you can give a tag one or more "classes" to say, for example, what
              <i>kind</i> of paragraph you've got. You do it by putting some extra
              information in the <b>opening tag</b> of the paragraph:
              <code>
                &lt;p class="poem"&gt;
                  Turtle, turtle, on the ground
                  Pink and shiny, turn around.
                &lt;/p&gt;
              </code>
              Now we've got a way to say, in HTML, "Hey, Browser!  This is a 
              paragraph, but it's a <i>poem</i> paragraph, unlike all my other
              boring paragraphs."  Great!  Except ... how do we use CSS to tell
              the browser how our poems should look?
              <p>
              In CSS, remember that each <b>rule</b> consists of a "selector"
              and a "rule body".  So far we've seen really simple selectors that
              just mean, "every <b>p</b> tag in the whole page".  Well we can 
              now say, "every <b>p</b> tag that's a poem" like this:
              <code>
                p.poem {
                  white-space: pre;
                }
              </code>
              The class name "poem" is added to the tag name ("p") with a period
              character. So "p.poem" means, to the browser, that the rule body
              applies not to every single "p" tag, but <b>only</b> to "p" tags
              that are marked as being poems!
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Thinking Inside And Outside The Box</dt>
            <dd>
              Think about that imaginary newspaper again.
              Sometimes, content is broken down in a more
              complicated way than just a list of boxes.
              Sometimes there are boxes inside other boxes.
              <p>
              In HTML, you can put a tag <i>inside</i> another
              tag:
              <code>
                &lt;div&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                    This is a short sentence.
                  &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;
                    Another paragraph.
                  &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              That's a box inside a box!
              <p>
              Next time we'll talk about some crazy stuff we can do
              with boxes inside boxes, classes, and CSS.
