            <dd>
              Last week, we talked about a couple of new tags,
              <span class='code'>img</span> and <span class='code'>button</span>.
              We built a simple "dynamic" page that used a button to make
              things happen to a <span class='code'>div</span> tag. To
              do that, we wrote some simple JavaScript code to handle
              an <span class='terminology'>event</span> from the browser
              when the button was clicked.  That was pretty cool.
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Boxes. Or blocks. Whatever.</dt>
            <dd>
              Recall that HTML content is, over-simplifying a little, either
              <span class='terminology'>block content</span> or
              <span class='terminology'>inline content</span>.
              Generally, inline content is inside block elements (tags), like
              <span class='code'>div</span> or <span class='code'>p</span> tags.
              <p>
              Blocks stack on top of each other, top to bottom.
              We're going to look at several ways that CSS can control
              the way blocks look.  First, we have to look at how blocks
              look as far as the browser is concerned, without any extra
              direction from CSS.
            </dd>

            <dt>Block Layout</dt>
            <dd>
              Let's use <span class='code'>div</span> as the basic element
              to talk about, because it's so simple.
              If you give a browser a <span class='code'>div</span> tag
              with some words in it, like this:
              <code>
                &lt;div&gt;
                  Hello. This is a story of a cat, and a very
                  strange little mouse that became the cat's
                  friend.
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              The "box" that the browser makes for a block element has to
              have a size, or else it wouldn't be much of a box. How does
              the browser figure out how big the box is?
              <p>
              Well without any other rules from CSS, the browser does this.
              First, the <span class='terminology'>width</span> of the
              box will be the width of the bigger box surrounding it.
              For simple blocks on a simple page, that's going to be the
              width of the whole page.
              Then, the browser lets the <span class='terminology'>height</span>
              of the box kind-of "stretch" bigger and bigger so that all the inline
              content &mdash; that is, whatever is inside the box &mdash; is contained
              inside of it.
            </dd>

            <dt>Lord Of The Boxes</dt>
            <dd>
              With CSS rules, there are all sorts of things about block elements
              that can be controlled.
              The most basic things, as you may guess, are the height and the
              width of the box.
              The CSS properties involved are, thankfully, called
              <span class='code'>height</span> and <span class='code'>width</span>.
              We might want to create some narrow boxes, so we could do that by
              using a class:
              <code>
                &lt;div class="narrow"&gt;
                  Sometimes skinny things can be very interesting.
                &lt;/div&gt;
              </code>
              We can set up CSS to control those like this:
              <code>
                div.narrow {
                  width: 200px;
                }
              </code>
              That rule tells the browser that <span class='code'>div</span>
              elements with the class "narrow" should be 200 pixels (dots) wide.
              (There are lots of ways of specifying measurements in the browser;
              at some point we'll talk about that.)
              When you use CSS to control the width, then as the browser lays
              out the inline content inside the block, it knows that it needs
              to start a new "line" whenever it exhausts a 200-pixel wide line.
              <p>
              Similarly, we can use CSS to set the height of a box:
              <code>
                div.shrimpy {
                  height: 100px;
                }
              </code>
              Now the thing about setting the height of a box that's different
              from setting the width is that it's a lot harder to figure out what
              to do with excess inline content.
              When the box is just narrow, the browser just has to make the lines
              of inline content shorter, but it can keep on going down making
              the box bigger and bigger.
              If we tell it how tall the box is, however, what's it supposed
              to do when it runs out of room?
            </dd>

            <dt>Two Pound Sausage, One Pound Bag</dt>
            <dd>
              The problem of what to do when the inline content in a box
              is just too big to fit, based on CSS rules for height and
              width, is called <span class='terminology'>overflow</span>.
              If you don't tell the browser otherwise (with CSS), the
              browser does something that might seem pretty weird: it just
              lets the content of the block spill outside of it, as if the
              box "walls" weren't even there.
              In other words, if you make a block and use CSS to tell
              the browser that the box should be 100 pixels tall, but then
              you put a paragraph in the box that's way too big, the
              browser just keeps going and going as if the box weren't
              even there.
              <p>
              Well of course CSS has control over that behavior. There's
              a CSS property for block elements called (again, thankfully)
              <span class='code'>overflow</span>.
              The overflow property can have the following values:
              <ul>
                <li><span class='code'>visible</span> is the default; that is, it's what the browser does if you don't tell it otherwise.
                <li><span class='code'>hidden</span> means that the block should be like a window, and if the inner inline content
                doesn't fit, it just gets cut off or "clipped".
                <li><span class='code'>auto</span> makes the box size "real", like "hidden" does, but instead of just hiding the content
                it gives you <span class='terminology'>scroll bars</span> as necessary when the content is too big.
                <li><span class='code'>scroll</span> is like "auto", but it always shows you scroll bars, even when the content is
                not too big. (This one is pretty rarely used, in my experience.)
              </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>Good Fences Make Good Neighbors</dt>
            <dd>
              These "boxes" that we're making are actually more-or-less invisible.
              You can tell they're there, because (for example) if you make a 
              block that's narrow you can see that the content is narrow.
              (<a href='http://jsfiddle.net/Pointy/sCC5k/'>Here is a jsfiddle</a> with a narrow
              block for you to look at. It should be pretty obvious.)
              <p>
              Very often, it's nice to have some way to visually set off the
              inline content from the rest of the page.
              On real web pages, there are blocks of content all over the place.
              If it was all just black text on a white background, it'd be kind-of
              confusing.
              <p>
              How can we set off one block from another? Well, there are
              several ways:
              <ul>
                <li>The box could have a line around it
                <li>The box could be a different color
                <li>The box could be pushed away from other boxes
              </ul>
              CSS provides us with all sorts of tools to do that kind of thing.
              <p>
              The first thing we'll look at is how to draw a line around a box.
              In the HTML/CSS world, those lines are called
              <span class='terminology'>borders</span>.
              In CSS, you can create a rule to put a border around a box
              like this:
              <code>
                div.with-border {
                  border: 1px;
                }
              </code>
              The CSS property "border" is actually a short cut for several other,
              more specific properties, <span class='code'>border-width</span>,
              <span class='code'>border-color</span>, and
              <span class='code'>border-style</span>.
              The assumed value of border-width is 0, so boxes have no border
              around them by default.
              That CSS for the "with-border" elements sets the "border-width"
              to 1 pixel. The color is assumed to be black, and the "style
              is assumed to be "solid."  The only really useful values of
              "border-style" are "solid" and "none"; there are some others
              but web browsers don't really do them reliably.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <dt>Red Is Pretty</dt>
          <dd>
            We can use CSS to tell the browser what color the lines
            around a box should be:
            <code>
              div.pretty-border {
                border: 1px red;
              }
            </code>
            The "1px" in the CSS rule makes the border a single pixel
            thick, and "red" makes the border red.
            That rule is a shortcut for this:
            <code>
              div.pretty-border {
                border-width: 1px;
                border-color: red;
              }
            </code>
            Borders are, oddly enough, not considered to be part of the
            width of the box. If you say a box should be 200 pixels wide,
            and it also has a 10 pixel wide border on each side, then it
            will really be 220 pixels wide over all. (That behavior can
            drive web developers crazy sometimes.)
          </dd>

          <dt>Give Me Room, Lots Of Room</dt>
          <dd>
            Boxes with borders can look pretty cramped, because the browser
            will run inline content right up to the very edge.
            To keep the inline content away from the edge, you can 
            add <span class='terminology'>padding</span> to the block
            with some CSS.  Telling the browser to add padding means
            that it will leave more empty space between the edges of
            your inline content and the box edge.
            <code>
              div.pretty-border {
                border: 1px red;
                padding: 3px 3px 3px 3px;
              }
            </code>
            Those four separate measurements for the padding are
            for the top, the right side, the bottom, and the left
            side of the box, in that order. (That's a common thing
            in CSS rules like this one.)
            <p>
            You can try adding a border and some padding to that
            <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/Pointy/sCC5k/'>weird story about the mouse</a>
            if you want.
          <dd>
          
          <dt>Box To Box</dt>
          <dd>
            Padding lets you keep stuff inside a box from getting too
            close to the edges. Outside the box, you might want to keep
            boxes from bumping right up against each other. To do that,
            you can give a block element a <span class='terminology'>margin</span>.
            Margins are like padding, but they're outside the border of the
            box instead of inside.
            <code>
              div.dont-touch-me {
                margin: 10px 5px 10px 5px;
              }
            </code>
            That CSS rule sets up a margin of 10 pixels on the top and bottom
            of the box, and 5 pixels on the side. (The side?  Wait a sec - don't
            boxes pile on top of each other? Where does stuff on the side come
            from?  We'll see!)
          </dd>

          <dt>Round Corners</dt>
          <dd>
            Rounding off the corners of our boxes makes them, well, rounder.
            In CSS we can use the "border-radius" property to make corners
            round.  The "roundness" is set by giving the size of a circle's
            radius. A big radius means a big circle, and a small radius means
            a small circle.
            <code>
              div.rounded {
                border-radius: 5px;
              }
            </code>
          </dd>

          <dt>And Now For Something Completely Different</dt>
          <dd>
            Last time we did some fooling around with <span class='code'>button</span>
            elements. We wrote some JavaScript code to respond to "click" events
            on the button.
            <p>
            This time we're going to talk about a couple of other events, "mouseenter"
            and "mouseleave".
            Those happen when you move your mouse around and it goes over (or away from)
            some element on the page.
            <p>
            Here's a fun effect we can put together.  You see this sometimes on websites
            that are showing you stuff they want you to buy.  We're going to make boxes
            get "swollen borders" but we'll do it in such a way that they won't shift
            around on the page. The trick is this: we'll give some boxes a thin border,
            and also some margin and some padding.  Then, when we detect a "mouseover"
            event, we can make the border a little fatter and the padding 
            a little smaller. That way, the total size of padding plus margin plus border
            will be the same as when the mouse is far away. (This looks a lot cooler
            than it sounds.)
            <p>
            We'll do this with some JavaScript assisted by some CSS, just like when we did our button clicker. 
            The main differences are this:
            <ol>
              <li>Before, we used element "id" values to find them. Here, we'll use
              a class. That way, it will be easy to do the same thing to a bunch of
              elements. The class name I used in the example is "tricky".
              <li>There are two events to handle, not just one.
            </ol>
            This is what our JavaScript will look like:
            <code>
              $('div.tricky').mouseenter(function() {
                $(this).addClass('moused');
              });
              $('div.tricky').mouseleave(function() {
                $(this).removeClass('moused');

            Another thing thats new is that word "this". Last time, we always passed
            a quoted CSS selector. Here, the word "this" has a very special meaning
            in JavaScript, and in particular with our handy library jQuery. Inside
            a function that's used for browser events, like our little functions here,
            the word "this" means, "the element that's involved with the event". Thus,
            what we do is tell jQuery that we want to add (or remove) a class from the
            element that the event happened to.

            Some other things to think about:
            <ul>
              <li>Could you make the boxes more or less round when the mouse
              moves over an element?
              <li>Can you change the color of the border too?
              <li>What if you wanted a different color for each of the elements?
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </section>
      </div>
    </div>
