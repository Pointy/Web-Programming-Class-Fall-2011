            <dt>Review</dt>
            <dd>
              Last week, we talked &mdash; no, I talked &mdash; about colors.
              I went on at length about how colors and light are the most important
              thing ever.
              We looked at different ways people have represented colors for computers
              and about how colors work in HTML and CSS.
              <p>
              This week we're going to spend some time talking about what bugs
              are, where they come from, and what we can do to fix them.
              We'll talk about tools that are available in (or for) web browsers
              to help with that process.
            </dd>

            <dt>Bugs</dt>
            <dd>
              Recall that "computer programming" means, "telling a computer what
              to do," and that "web programming", our occupation, means, "telling
              a web browser what to do."
              In that context, the term "bug" means, "something that the computer
              (or web browser) does that we don't want it to do," or "something that
              it doesn't do that we do want it to do."
              <p>
              From that definition, it's clear that a "bug" might take on many,
              many variations:
              <ul>
                <li>Content on the page that's not supposed to be there;
                <li>Missing content;
                <li>Content in the wrong place;
                <li>Content that looks different from the way we want;
                <li>Interactions (mouse clicks, keyboard actions, etc) that don't happen when we want;
                <li>Interactions that do happen when we don't want;
                <li>Interactions that have the wrong effect;
              </ul>
              Believe me, I could go on and on.  There's no way to count how many
              bugs there might be. There might even be bugs in the web browser itself
              that cause things not to work, or to work differently than we expect.
            </dd>

            <dt>Bug Origins</dt>
            <dd>
              Where do bugs come from?
              Well, one of the most important things to accept as a programmer
              is that, while it's possible that system (or "platform") bugs &mdash;
              bugs in other software or hardware that you rely on for your own
              code to work &mdash; might be the cause of bugs you're experiencing
              in something you're working on, the simple fact is that almost all
              bugs you see are ultimately your problems.
              In web programming, this can be especially frustrating, in that 
              though web browsers, as software platforms go, have a whole lot
              of bugs of their own (some more than others), you have to accept
              them and deal with them because you really can't change the way
              that the browsers work!
              <p>
              So, most of the time (really, almost always), when you see something
              not work the way you expect, it means you've done something wrong.
              In a way, that makes programming an easier academic pursuit than
              some others, because you often find out that you've made a mistake
              almost immediately. (Sometimes, of course, you don't, because some
              bugs only happen to certain web browsers in certain situations.)
              That means that when you see a bug, you have to work backwards and 
              do a little basic detective work to find it.
              In other words, when you're thinking about how to make something
              work, you start from "what do I want to do?", and then through,
              "how should I do it?", and then you start typing stuff in.  Well,
              when you see a bug, you have to think, "what's supposed to happen?"
              and then, "how did I think that would work?" and then "what did
              I try to do to make it work?".
              <p>
              This detective work can be, at times, incredibly hard. It can also
              be incredibly easy. It's hard to predict.
              The most important thing to remember is to approach the problem
              based on the evidence you have, and to resist as strongly as you
              can the temptation to blame something other than your own work.
            </dd>

            <dt>Gathering Evidence</dt>
            <dd>
              Whenever you do detective work, evidence is the foundation
              of all the thinking you do.
              Thus, when you find a bug, gathering evidence about the bug
              is definitely the most important job.  Here's a rough list
              of things to think about:
              <ul>
                <li>Is it really a bug?  Is what's happening really wrong?
                (This is especially important when somebody else tells you about the bug.)
                <li>Does the bug happen all the time or just sometimes?
                <li>How much of the rest of the web page (or whatever) does work properly?
                <li>What aspect of the web page is affected?
                <li>What has to happen in order to see the bug?
                <li>Is there anything that can happen that makes the bug not be seen?
              </ul>
              That's an incomplete list of course.
              The point is that it really is an experimental process.
              Your web program is, in a real sense, unique, and it may very
              well be that the bug in your program is the first such bug
              ever seen by any human being ever.
              Thus, there's not going to be any place to go look up a 
              solution, or at least no easy place.
              Even if there were, it's vital that you understand enough
              about your bug to describe the problem; otherwise, no "magic
              oracle" will be able to help you anyway.
              <p>
              Like a scientist in another discipline, tools can help extend
              your own senses to help you gather more and better evidence.
              The tools available in modern web browsers are amazingly
              powerful, but they're designed for serious business so they're
              not always "friendly".  That said, the world of the web
              programmer today is far, far better in this regard than it
              was just a few years ago.
              <p>
              The tools you have available vary from web browser to web
              browser. I'll talk mostly about what's available in Firefox
              and what's available in Google Chrome.
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Firebug</dt>
            <dd>
              The Firebug add-on for Firefox is available
              <a href='http://getfirebug.com/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
              It's free.
              When you install it, you'll see a little "bug" icon in your browser menu.
              Different versions of Firebug put the little bug in different places, so you may have
              to look for it. If you can't find it, then you can hit the "F12" key on your
              keyboard to activate it.
              <p>
              Firebug is, in my opinion, the best web browser bug helper tool (or, "debugger').
              It lets you mess around with the following things:
              <ul>
                <li>The HTML of your page
                <li>The CSS settings for each element
                <li>JavaScript
                <li>Network interactions between your browser and the server
              </ul>
              Without something like Firebug, you're in the dark, really, but with
              it you can find out a tremendous amount of information about what's
              going on in a web page.
              <p>
              It would take a really long time to just talk about what it does,
              so I'll do some demonstrations.
            </dd>

            <dt>Chrome</dt>
            <dd>
              The Google Chrome browser includes some built-in "Developer tools".
              You get to them from the Chrome menu.
              The tools you get in Chrome are mostly the same sort of thing that
              Firebug gives you. In a couple of details, the Chrome tools are a
              little bit nicer, but overall there are things that Firebug does
              really well that leads me to prefer that over Chrome.
              However, some people feel otherwise.
