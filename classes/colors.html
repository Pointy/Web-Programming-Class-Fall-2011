            <dt>Review</dt>
            <dd>
              Last week, we looked at the different kinds of values in JavaScript.
              We saw numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and the weird non-value null.
              We saw that objects can have properties that act kind-of like variables, in
              that they're places to keep values.
              <p>
              This week we're going to do a modified calculator that'll allow operations
              between colors. Along the way we'll talk about colors in general, colors
              in computers (and on computer screens), and how colors work in HTML and
              CSS (and, therefore, JavaScript).
            </dd>
            
            <dt>Colors</dt>
            <dd>
              One of the interesting things about computer programming as a way to make a
              living is that there are so many other things you learn about while doing it.
              The topic of colors is a good example. The question, "what is a color?" may
              seem simple, but if you really think about how you'd answer that to a person 
              who really doesn't know, I think you'll agree that it'd be kind-of hard.
              What would you say?
              <p>
              Color theory (and the study of light in general) is a surprisingly complex
              field, and it's only fairly recently that people have been able to provide
              good answers. That means that for most of recorded human history, nobody
              really could answer the question, "what is a color?". I can't teach all about
              color theory because I don't know much about it. However, because I've had
              to deal with colors in computer programs, I've had to learn a little bit
              about it.
              <p>
              Everything inside a computer, you'll recall, ultimately has to look like a
              number or a series of numbers. Colors are no exception: inside the computer,
              they're represented as numbers. How?  Well, we're going to have to find 
              out a little about how colors work.
            </dd>

            <dt>Light</dt>
            <dd>
              First, we have to think about why it is that we want to fool around with
              colors in our computer program in the first place.
              What do we need to do with colors?  Well, we want parts of our web page
              to show up on the screen glowing in some particular colors.  In other
              words, we want to tell the web browser what color to make different
              elements.
              In many of the examples we've played with, we've used CSS to control
              colors. Generally we used words like "red" and "green", but those, it
              turns out, are just convenient short-cuts.
              <p>
              In the early 1800's, a really smart Englishman named Thomas Young was
              the first person to figure out that the really interesting thing about
              color is the fact that our eyes somehow see it. He proposed that we see
              colors the way we do because our eyes have receptors in them for seeing
              light of particular colors and then blending those so that we perceive 
              all the colors we do.
              <p>
              In fact, what the nerves in your eyes can do is detect light of
              certain wavelengths, with different varieties of nerve cells having 
              a few (three) different ranges of sensitivity.  Through a fantastically
              complicated process, signals from those nerves end up making our brains
              "see" the colors we see.
              <p>
              Through a dramatic over-simplification of the mathematical and physiological
              realities of color perception, the bottom line is that the colors you see
              can be thought of as a combination of some selected particular colors,
              each mixed in some "strength" or intensity. Traditionally, the color space
              we perceive is called "R<sup>3</sup><sub>color</sub>", which is a system
              where the selected colors added toghether are red, green, and blue.
            </dd>

            <dt>Color Computer Screens</dt>
            <dd>
              Because we can model human vision as a process of adding together particular
              amounts of red, green, and blue light, it should be obvious how you'd make
              a computer screen that can show selected colors at any point on the screen:
              all you need is for each "dot" (pixel) to be able to mix red, green, and
              blue at chosen strengths for each of the component colors.
              <p>
              Over the years since people have been making computers, there have been various
              specific ways of setting things up so that those pixels can be told what to do.
              Nowadays, however, there's really just one setup in common use, and thankfully
              it's about the simplest way to do it.
              Each pixel is controled by assigning it a "triplet" of three numbers. One
              number tells it how bright the red light should be, another the green, and
              the third, the blue.  Each of the numbers can be any value between zero (which
              means that the color is completely turned off) and 255 (which means that the
              color should be as bright as it can possibly be).
              <p>
              Telling a pixel to be color [0, 0, 0], then, is telling it to turn all the colors
              off.  What would that look like?
              <p>
              Telling a pixel to be [255, 255, 255] is telling it to turn all the colors on,
              full blast. What would that look like?
            </dd>

            <dt>Colors via Web Browsers</dt>
            <dd>
              Through CSS, web browsers let us tell them what colors to make text show up
              on the screen, and what colors our element backgrounds and borders should be.
              We've seen the shortcut ways ("red" and "green" etc), so now we can look at
              the real underlying way that those red-green-blue "triplets" are represented.
              There are two numeric ways that colors can be expressed.
              <p>
              The first, and original, way that colors are expressed is as a six-digit
              number in base 16 (often called "hex", short for "hexadecimal").
              What's base 16?  Well imagine if people had eight fingers
              on each hand instead of five. If we did, then instead of switching to multi-digit
              numbers when we get to ten we'd just move on to our other fingers. It wouldn't be 
              until we got to 16 that we'd need another digit! Base 16 numbers come up a lot
              in computer programming because the basic storage units inside the computer
              are clumped in groups numbering various powers of 2, like 4, 8, 16, 32, and
              64.  A four-digit base-2 number (that is, four zeros and ones) can represent
              sixteen distinct numbers.
              <p>
              As you might guess, those 6-digit color numbers are six digits long because
              they're divided up into the red part, the green part, and the blue part.
              And yes, two base-16 digits can represent any value from zero up to 255!
              It's all really great, except that humans don't actually have eight fingers.
              <p>
              We won't go into the math of converting back and forth between base 10 and
              base 16 (though it's pretty easy), so for now here's what you need to know:
              <ul>
                <li>The digits in base 16 are our familiar base 10 digits, plus "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", and "f". The letters are sometimes written as capitals; it doesn't matter in CSS which you use.
                <li>The digit "a" has the value 10, "b" is 11, and so on up to "f" which is 15.
                <li>In a 6-digit color number, the first two characters (digits) represent the red value. The second two are green, and the third two are blue.
                <li>The two-hex-digit number "ff" is the biggest such number, and it's 255.
              </ul>
              In CSS, a color value must be preceded with a "#" character so that the browser
              doesn't think we just misspelled "red".  Thus:
              <code>
                body { background-color: #336699; }
              </code>
              That makes the background be the color with "33" for red, "66" for green, and "99" for blue.
              Because the blue number is the biggest, the overall effect is a shade of blue.
              <p>
              Over the past couple of years, newer browsers have allowed a simpler representation
              for RGB colors, which looks like this:
              <code>
                body { backgound-color: rgb(51, 102, 153); }
              </code>
              That gives the same color as "#336699".
            </dd>

            <dt>Alpha<dt>
            <dd>
              The other way to represent colors is relatively new in the world of web browsers, 
              though it's been common in other computer applications for a long time.
              The neat thing about this second color notation is that it also lets us control
              how a color should blend with other colors. The representation is called "rgba",
              or "red-green-blue-alpha".  The "alpha" part can be thought of as the "strength"
              of the red-green-blue color.
              <p>
              A good way to understand how this color mixing works is to imagine that all your
              HTML elements are like little pieces of colored plastic, all arranged on top of
              the body element. Starting from the body, then, you mix "up" starting from white.
              Every element over a given pixel contributes it's color, with the "alpha" value
              controlling how "strong" the color is.
              <p>
              An RGB color with "alpha" is expressed like this:
              <code>
                #something {
                  background-color: rgba(200, 40, 20, 0.5);
                }
              </code>
              That CSS sets the background color of the selected element to a reddish
              color, but with only "0.5" for the "alpha" value. That means that the
              color is at half strength, Or, thinking about our plastic things, it's
              like a piece of red plastic that's about 1/2 transparent.  A smaller "alpha"
              value (like 0.2) is like a lighter-colored piece of plastic, and a bigger
              "alpha" is like a less-transparent, darker piece of plastic.
            </dd>

            <dt>Oh Wait Yet Another Color Method</dt>
            <dd>
              So I lied when I said there were just two ways to represent colors. There's
              also another way, one that looks kind-of like "rgba" but which is quite
              different.
              <p>
              Another way to represent colors is with a schema called "HSL".  The letters
              stand for "hue" &mdash; which kind-of means the basic color &mdash; "saturation" &mdash;
              which represents the amount of white mixed with the fundamental color &mdash; and
              "lightness", which is sort-of the "brightness" but slightly different in weird 
              ways that I don't entirely understand.
              <p>
              Using HSL colors is a totally different way of thinking about the nature of
              a color. Instead of thinking about mixing the more-or-less arbitrary red, green,
              and blue "primary" additive colors, you start from the idea of a color on a 
              circle of all basic color tones that we can see. That's the "hue".  It's a
              circle for basically mathematical reasons (of extraordinary complexity).
              The "hue" value is like a measurement on a protractor of degrees around a
              circle.
              <p>
              The "saturation" value reflects how "deep" or "pale" a color is. Paler colors
              like pink have more white mixed in that deeper colors like scarlet or pure red.
              The "lightness" value is sort-of the opposite of "saturation". Both lightness
              and saturation are expressed as percentages, between 0% and 100%. Thus, a 
              "pure" color is a hue measurement with a 100% saturation (no white mixed in)
              and a 50% lightness (halfway between too bright and too dark).
              <p>
              HSL values can have an "alpha" value too, so when expressed in CSS such
              colors look like this:
              <code>
                #something {
                  background-color: hsla(200, 80%, 50%, 0.9);
                }
              </code>
              That color is a hue at 200 degrees around the color circle (a blue-ish color),
              with 80% saturation (pretty deep) and 50% lightness (balanced).
            </dd>

            <dt>Things To Do</dt>
            <dd>
              <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/Pointy/FpsV9/5/' target='_blank'>Here is the exercise for this week.</a>.
              This is different from other of our exercises because it's all done, and it's just a toy
              for playing with colors.
              <p>
              You'll see that there's a clump of "div" elements set up as circles at the top.
              Below that, there are some controls to set the colors.
              What these controls let you do is fool around with color combinations and
              see how those look when they combine with different "alpha" values.
              <p>
              We'll basically just play with this page. On the RGBA controls, the red, green, and blue values
              should be numbers from 0 to 255, and the "alpha" should be a decimal number between 0 and 1.
              For the HSLA colors, the "hue" should be a number between 0 and 359, the "saturation" and "lightness"
              should be percentages (0% to 100%), and the "alpha" is as with RGBA.
