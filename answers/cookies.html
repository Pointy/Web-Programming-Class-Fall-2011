          <h1>What do "cookies" do? Are they bad? Can I "opt out" of them?</h1>
          <p>
          A web <b>cookie</b> is a piece of information from a web site.
          Every cookie has a name &mdash; like "LAST_VISIT" or "SESSION" or "BX7YZZR" &mdash; and
          a value &mdash; like "09 Sep 2011" or "78704".
          A web site can send your web browser one or more cookies any time your browser
          asks for a web page (or, actually <i>anything</i>) from the site.
          Your browser will save the cookies inside your computer. Every time
          you go back to a particular site for more information (that is, every
          time you click something that goes to another page), your browser
          sends all your cookies <i>back to the web site</i>.
          <p>
          Cookies were "invented" in the mid-1990's by a company called "Netscape". (It's
          a little weird for me to have to tell you about a long ago and far away company
          like Netscape, because in 1996 it was really hard to imagine that Netscape would
          essentially disappear.  Such is the world of Internet business.)  The idea was
          that web sites needed some way to keep track of you.  The underlying way that
          web browsers talk to web sites is a scheme called a "protocol".  A protocol is
          a way to organize how one computer "talks to" another one.  People use the word
          to describe things like the formal etiquette to be used when important diplomats
          from another country are meeting with people in our country.  In the same way,
          a computer protocol is a formal specification laying out the rules for how
          each computer in a "conversation" should behave.
          <p>
          Anyway, the basic web protocol is called <b>HTTP</b>.  The HTTP protocol is
          called <i>stateless</i> because every interaction using the protocol is sort
          of its own unique self.  It's as if every single time your browser talks to
          Amazon, it goes like, "Hello, Amazon, my name is Mike McNally, I speak English,
          and I'm using Firefox. I am interested in seeing something about kitchen knives."
          The next time your browser talks to Amazon &mdash; like, the next time you click
          something on the Amazon page you're looking at &mdash; the browser starts all 
          over with "Hello, Amazon, my name is Mike McNally, I speak English, and I'm
          using Firefox."
          <p>
          So because the beginning of every HTTP interaction was like two people meeting
          each other for the very first time, people wanting to make interesting web sites
          that could have more of a "conversation" with you needed <i>something</i> better
          than that.  The idea of a cookie, therefore, is to make it possible for your web
          browser to send back enough information that the site could know to say, "Oh, hello Mr.
          McNally.  What more can I do for you today?"  It's like going to a shoe store and
          giving the salesman a piece of paper with your name and shoe size on it every time you
          ask to look at another pair of shoes.
          <p>
          Thus, I hope you can see that for a lot of purposes you really need cookies in order
          to make web sites actually work nicely and properly for your benefit.  Without them, things can
          get really goofy.  The negative aspect of cookies, however, stems directly from
          the basic setup.  Companies that may not be interested only in being polite and
          helpful can use cookies to gather information and analyze things you do on the
          web in ways that are not necessarily in your best interest.
          <p>
          Now, it's important to know that your browser is <b>very</b> careful about
          managing the cookies it knows about.  Any given cookie will only ever be sent
          back to the web site where it came from. In other words, if you pick up a 
          cookie from Amazon (and, if you visit Amazon, you definitely will unless you've
          told your browser to ignore them), your browser will only send that cookie 
          back to "amazon.com" web sites.  If you leave Amazon and go to Facebook,
          your browser will absolutely never send your Amazon cookies to Facebook.
          <p>
          One other quick note: in addition to cookies, each time your browser starts another
          HTTP interaction with any web site, it sends along the name of the web site
          where a "link" to the target web site was found.  We'll talk about links later, but
          for now just think of it as something you click on to go to some other web
          site, or another part of the same web site.  This piece of information the browser
          sends is called the "Referer" (yes, it's mispelled; the person who came up with this
          idea a long time ago was not a native English speaker).
          <p>
          The simplest way that &mdash; I don't want to say "bad"; how about "questionable" &mdash; web sites
          use cookies to "follow you around" on the web is like this.  Remember how I said that
          every HTTP interaction starts off with your browser sending back all of the cookies it
          knows about to the web site you're talking to?  Well, that also happens when a web page
          has an image (like a photograph or something) in it.  Images are always loaded separately
          from the contents of a main HTML program. In other words, a web page is written to say,
          "I need that picture of a cute kitten right here", and that means to the web browser that
          it needs to use <i>another</i> HTTP request to go get that kitten picture.  Your browser
          does not make any distinctions about that kind of request, so on that request all the
          cookies are sent <i>again</i>.
          <p>
          Now the story gets even more strange:  web browsers will allow any web page from any
          web site to request images (cute kittens, or anything else) from <i>any random web page
          anywhere</i>.  That may seem crazy, but it's an important necessisity for a lot of
          confusing and complicated reasons that I won't go into.  The point is that that's
          just the way things are. 
          <p>
          OK, so now we know that a web page, by referencing an image, can thereby tell your
          browser to go and do <i>another</i> HTTP interaction.  We also know that those
          interactions will send any appropriate cookies back to any web site whenever it
          talks to it with HTTP. Oh, and don't forget about the "Referer"!
          <p>
          Let's set up an example.  There's you, going to the web site "smartrobots.com" to find
          out about robots.  There's the Smart Robot company, which maintains that web site. 
          Then there's a company called "Customer Stalkers Inc", that tells other companies
          that they can provide interesting information about the people looking at their
          web sites.  The folks at the Smart Robot company think it would be useful if they
          knew whether customers were interested in robots that do housework, or instead
          if they're more interested in robots that mow lawns and trim hedges outdoors.
          The salesman from Customer Stalkers Inc. assures the Smart Robot gang that they
          can help, because they can provide just that sort of information about many web
          site visitors.
          <p>
          How does Customer Stalkers Inc. do it?  How can they possibly tell the Smart Robot
          company (well, the company's web site) anything interesting about web site visitors?
          Here's how:
          <ol>
            <li>Smart Robot makes a deal with Customer Stalkers Inc. and agrees to pay them some money for information.
            <li>Customer Stalkers Inc. tells the Smart Robot people to add a tiny image to each of their HTML pages. The
            tiny image &mdash; usually one that's totally invisible &mdash; is <i>not</i> kept on the
            "smartrobots.com" web site, however.  Instead, the image will come from the Customer Stalkers Inc.
            web site.
            <li>Because Smart Robot is not the first company that Customer Stalkers Inc. has made such a deal with,
            there are lots of other web sites that have similar tiny invisible images, all coming from
            the Customer Stalkers Inc. web site.
            <li>Now, this brings us back to you.  You're using the web, going around looking at things that
            interest you.  Maybe you browse a web site about drought-tolerant gardening, or how to grow super-huge
            tomatoes, or how to keep your lawn from turning brown.  Maybe some of those web sites you visit
            are operated by companies that have <i>also</i> made deals with Customer Stalkers Inc.
            <li>Each time you go to a web site, in other words, it's possible that there's a tiny little
            image from Customer Stalkers Inc. on the page. Every time your browser fetches that image,
            of course, it sends back all the "customerstalkers.com" cookies stored in your browser. It
            also sends the "Referer", so that Customer Stalkers Inc. knows what web site you're looking
            at!
          </ol>
          Over time, therefore, Customer Stalkers Inc. can know about many web sites you visit. They don't
          really know exactly who you are, but they don't care.  They can sell the information they've 
          collected about you based on the Internet address of your computer (and various other individually
          harmless details).  There are also other similar schemes; lots of them, in fact. Some are
          intended to gather information about you, and some are intended to provide less personal
          statistical information.
          <p>
          In my opinion, it's not really a huge problem as long as you know that it's happening. The
          best way to avoid being "victimized" is to completely ignore any and all Internet advertising.
          Another thing you can do is switch off the "Referer" feature. Not all browsers allow that, 
          but Firefox definitely does. (For those with elevated concerns over security, Firefox is
          a really good choice of browser.  It's produced by a non-profit foundation, and they have
          very high privacy standards. Firefox will let you control many aspects of its behavior.)
          A few old web sites rely on "Referer" being set, but most modern ones don't (because it's
          a terrible feature that doesn't work very well anyway).
